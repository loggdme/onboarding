## What is Loggd Onboarding about?

This platform is your gateway to becoming a proficient developer at Loggd. We believe in **learning by doing**, which is why our onboarding is structured around practical projects that simulate real-world development challenges you'll encounter here. You won't just read about concepts; you'll build with them.
